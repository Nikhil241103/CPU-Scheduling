# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains C implementations of essential CPU scheduling algorithms. These algorithms play a crucial role in operating systems, efficiently managing the execution of processes on a CPU. The implemented algorithms include:

- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**

## Getting Started

To run the code, compile `cpu_scheduling.c` using a C compiler. Ensure to provide appropriate input in `input.txt`, where process arrival times, burst times, and interrupt flags are specified. The output will be written to `output.txt`.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or would like to add more scheduling algorithms, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
